Be it the manager or the person placed @ cash counter , everyone had a mask on their face which was well appreciated.  The food is good over here.  Specially we had paneer tikka and my frnd had ordered a chicken tandoori which he liked the most. @ the end we had dal khichdi which we found the most happening khichdi which was been ordered on request.  All of the above there seem to be a good crowd coming in and the rates are also reasonable."",""Images"":[""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyH614mzUXplv7mGBWNQsuLomD4PsFbs5-G-i5=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxdPaX_oxoM6yZ1xEZ3wP23_O039te1SeC938H=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtWz_w2dwo7VkZmhm7Ki7Sae03ZcKUYgmdatYS=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0jfQKfBDwCbbECJoN-WKsfddo3qowEudh2cMN=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOOiM4EdF0cBQscqeESMRE8csD0EIJgK3rk6pU=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoeoMmvze-la5oAEmaEY-ub5AZG78AcF1hdX1R=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIfZtEJyQ4oNi9MSCg8N5Ccm1cFIKpKPbPl3Ej=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOa8g0CQBLUGhWuvBWGWFywg5ebvmeLlBLcMDz5=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcCo5lM9wcsZKhuCyTxYmT1cIbSW0na89pkV5f=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOB_MzF3ZKA8jRK3x14lV7z_swr2-OjGtFqX34K=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlPnKBA9op54BImrJJCL9xUKckEiG4ts36WEuL=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4-ryamUW2Ecaq0BeEjtDvIB2FRbiySWYPB5xI=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm69jDPNWDn6abzHO1-5s9uPbEDR4OipSh_JKS=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsx8S4B4Ug8AAMEILdTXxZ0NkGRbfnYrStl5EX=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjB-oznZev5qwUCEpUis6d2CmewEGH-DBvnOzc=w150-h150-k-no-p""],""When"":""2 years ago""},{""Name"":""Prathamesh Masurkar"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUpHu6poZY2C4Kf4kh7hAo9WffCM8FpnGK8D18VhPVWka_U=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Everytime we visited they gave us unique and tasty food\nTruely amazing taste and with good service 👍"",""Images"":[""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3ySNs3xQwPdgg97REPqsPLtaR5Qqptag5zzVB=w150-h150-k-no-p"",""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4cmEdE_IrqDHKwPYYiNivksOa_C-uE5DMvOjq=w150-h150-k-no-p""],""When"":""10 months ago""},{""Name"":""Vishal S"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUVYZfMOpyxIo5bIAVm6C0lq4bv_a5dfRbswlLNqj7vsqE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Food is tasty and reasonable.

As I am a new mom, I made a personal request if I can get a room to feed my baby and the staff did provide me a room, really helpful staff. Coming to the food, I ordered a Kiwi cooler and Legend special mocktail. Both the drinks were really good. I also ordered Paneer banjara kebab and BBq paneer, both of them really tasted awesome. We were only 2 to finish the food, hence were full with starters and mocktail only,  could not try anything in main course but will surely be back for the same.

The restaurant's ambience was truly delightful, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere that enhanced the entire dining experience.\n\nNow, let's talk about the food – it was absolutely fantastic! One dish, in particular, left me in awe: the Manchurian gravy. It was an explosion of flavors, perfectly balanced, and packed with deliciousness. The rich, tangy sauce coated the succulent Manchurian balls perfectly, making it an absolute treat for my taste buds. If you visit Regency, do not miss out on this mouthwatering delight!\n\nMoreover, the staff at Regency were incredibly friendly and attentive throughout my visit. They greeted me with warm smiles, promptly seated me, and provided excellent recommendations from their extensive menu. Their genuine hospitality made me feel welcomed and added to the overall positive experience.\n\nI would highly recommend Regency to anyone in search of a top-notch dining experience. Whether you're looking for a perfect evening out, a family gathering, or a special occasion, this restaurant ticks all the boxes. The ambience, the food, and the friendly staff make it a place worth visiting time and time again.\n\nThank you, Regency, for an unforgettable dining experience.

family outing. They serve veg nonveg and hard drinks as well. It was easy to get a table mid week, however on weekends the waiting time goes up to 20-25mins. I personally felt the place is small at the lower area, I couldn't get a chance to see the upper dining area, which probably causes the waiting. Quality wise the food was OK, i would rate 3.5/5. Quantity was better, more than sufficient for 2ppl. The dining place outside is nice but I won't suggest using it during summer times. Overall the place is nice and cosy for dinner with family and friends. The above quality and quantity was for veg.

dombivali city. As per my knowledge. This is their second branch at Manpada Road first branch is at Phadke Road Dombivli East. I ordered ragi Dosa and Rasam Vada ragi Dosa what is very basic and okay okay in test quality and presentation Sambar Chutney was as expected in any of the Udupi restaurants in Mumbai and suburbs. Not wow factor a Rasam Vada is the next dish which I ordered ball size Vadaj dipped in Rasam where very nice soft and spongy Rasam was too much sweet just like a sweet dish and with no flavours of Rasam.

We visited yesterday and wasted money on 3 worst dishes I've ate in my entire life.\n\nFood Review\n\n1: Veg Lolipop - 1 out of 5 stars. Absolutely worst thing. Wasted 220 for this. They dipped bland paneer, mashroom and vegetable tikka into lollipop batter and fried it. Only good thing was the crispy batter. But not worth the price. Do not buy at any cost.\n\n2: Cheese Pakoda - 0 out of 5 stars. How can you mess this up? Even a local restaurant make this better. Cheese was really sour and not even melted. It's like eating cold cheese in a fried batter. How's this even possible?\n\n3: Neer Dosa - 4 out of 5 stars. This was a good thing dish and worth the money. Tasty. Recommended to order this.\n\n4: Spring Roll - 3 out of 5 stars. It's fine. Taste is not as good as other fine dine restaurants but was served and cooed very well.\n\nService Review\n\nService is fast but waiters and captains are clueless and arrogant. They have waiters and captains running all over the place.\n\nOne dish is handled by 4 waiters before its served to customers.\n\nWhen we were critical about the dish the captain had no clue and he simply ignored us. Seriously?\n\nAfter all this they have the audacity to ask force tip.\n\nStreet food is far better than this horrible experience."",""Images"":[""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5aOG190DmnU8sro3g4LJe9iTfgu2-mTDdbS67=w150-h150-k-no-p""],""When"":""9 months ago""},{""Name"":""Punit JVaidya"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI5fqx1YpHyV4PvFB8veotHPc4qNyoBTscWNwSFmIOj=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The food is fantastic especially for pure veg lovers.
